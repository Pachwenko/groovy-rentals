## Development

To run the full stack at once the easiest way is with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/). With docker installed you can run (in the this folder) `docker-compose up`. This will automatically reload upon any changes. If you just want to run the backend for example you can do `docker-compose up backend`.

Otherwise you will need to run the frontend and backend simultaneously. Presently the backend uses sqlite so you do not need to run the database.
